# Sortings
Templated implementations of common sorting methods

NB : All these methods use std::vector<T> as container.
Might change that in the futur (to standard array for example) to get rid of that dependancy.

Contains the following sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Quick sort

Next steps 
  - Heap sort
  - Merge sort
  - Rading sort
  - Counting sort
