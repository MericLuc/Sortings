# Sortings
Templated implementations of common sorting methods

NB : All these methods use std::vector<T> as container.
Might change that in the futur (to standard array for example) to get rid of that dependancy.

Contains the following sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
  - Insertion sort  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
  - Selection sort  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
  - Quick sort      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
